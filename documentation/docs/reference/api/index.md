Simplyblock offers a comprehensive API to manage and automate cluster operations. This includes all cluster-wide
operations, logical volume-specific operations, health information, and 

 - Retrieve information about the cluster and its health status
 - Automatically manage a logical volume lifecycle
 - Integrate simplyblock into deployment processes and workflow automations
 - Create custom alerts and warnings

## Authentication

Any request to the simplyblock API requires authorization information to be provided. Unauthorized requests
return an HTTP status 401 (Unauthorized).

To provide authorization information, the simplyblock API uses the _Authorization_ HTTP header with a
combination of the cluster UUID and the cluster secret.

HTTP Authorization header:

```plain title="HTTP Authorization header"
Authorization: <CLUSTER_UUID> <CLUSTER_SECRET>
```

The cluster id is provided during the initial cluster installation. The cluster secret can be obtained using
the simplyblock commandline interface tool `{{ cliname }}`.

```bash title="Get Cluster Secret via CLI"
{{ cliname }} cluster get-secret CLUSTER_UUID
```

## PUT and POST Requests 

For requests that send a JSON payload to the backend endpoint, it is important to set the Content-Type header
accordingly. Requests that require this header to be set are of type HTTP PUT or HTTP POST.

The expected content type is `application/json`:

```plain title="Content-Type Header for JSON Requests"
Content-Type: application/json
```
