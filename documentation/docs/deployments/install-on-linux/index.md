Installing simplyblock for production on plain linux (Docker) requires a few components to be installed. Furthermore,
there are a couple of configuration steps to secure the network, ensure the performance, and data protection in the case
of hardware or software failures.

Simplyblock provides two test scripts to automatically check your system's configuration. While those may not catch all
edge cases, they can help to streamline the configuration check. This script can be run multiple times during the
preparation phase to find missing configurations during the process.

```bash title="Automatically check your configurations"
# Configuration check for the control plane (management nodes)
curl -s -L https://install.simplyblock.io/scripts/prerequisites-cp.sh | bash

# Configuration check for the storage plane (storage nodes)
curl -s -L https://install.simplyblock.io/scripts/prerequisites-sn.sh | bash
```

## Before We Start

A simplyblock production cluster consists of three different types of nodes in the plain linux (Docker) variant
of the deployment:

1. _Management nodes_ are part of the control plane which managed the cluster(s). 
2. _Storage nodes_ are part of a specific storage cluster and provide capacity to the distributed storage pool. A
   production cluster requires at least **three nodes**.
3. _Secondary nodes_ are part of a specific storage cluster and enable automatic fail over for NVMe-oF connections. In a
   high-availability cluster, every primary storage node automatically provides a secondary storage node.

In a plain-linux deployment multiple storage nodes can reside on the same host. This has to be done on multi-socket
systems as nodes have to be aligned with NUMA sockets. However, the management nodes require separate VMs.

A single control plane can manage one or more clusters. If started afresh, a control plane must be set up before
creating a storage cluster. If there is a preexisting control plane, an additional storage cluster can be added
to it directly.

More information on the control plane, storage plane, and the different node types is available under
[Simplyblock Cluster](../../architecture/concepts/simplyblock-cluster.md) in the architecture section.

## Network Preparation

For network requirements,
see [System Requirements](../deployment-preparation/hardware-requirements.md#network-requirements).

On storage nodes, simplyblock can use either one network interface for both storage and management 
or separate interfaces (VLANs or subnets).

To install simplyblock in your environment, you may have to adopt these commands to match your configuration.

| Network interface | Network definition | Abbreviation | Subnet          |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| eth0              | Control Plane      | control      | 192.168.10.0/24 |
| eth1              | Storage Plane      | storage      | 10.10.10.0/24   |
