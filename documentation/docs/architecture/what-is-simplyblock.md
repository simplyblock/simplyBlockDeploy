Simplyblock is a high-performance, distributed storage orchestration layer designed for cloud-native environments. It
provides NVMe over TCP (NVMe/TCP) block storage to hosts and offers block storage to containers through its Container
Storage Interface (CSI) and ProxMox drivers.

## What makes Simplyblock Special?

- **Environment Agnostic:** Simplyblock operates seamlessly across major cloud providers, regional, and specialized
  providers, bare-metal and virtual provisioners, and private clouds, including both virtualized and bare-metal
  Kubernetes environments.

- **NVMe-Optimized:** Simplyblock is built from scratch around NVMe. All internal and external storage access is
  entirely based on NVMe and NVMe over Fabric (TCP, RDMA). This includes local back-storage on storage nodes,
  host-to-cluster, and node-to-node traffic. Together with the user-space data plane, distributed data placement, and
  advanced quality of service (QoS) and other characteristics, this makes simplyblock the storage platform with the most
  advanced performance guarantees in hyper-converged solutions available today.

- **User-Space Data Plane:** Simplyblock data plane is built entirely in user-space with an interrupt-free, lockless,
  zero-copy architecture with thread-to-core pinning. The hot data path entirely avoids Linux kernel involvement, data
  copies, dynamic thread scheduling, and inter-thread synchronization. Its deployment is fully numa-node-aware.

- **Advanced QoS:** Simplyblock provides not only IOPS or throughput-based caps, but also true QoS service classes,
  effectively isolating IO traffic.

- **Distributed Data Placement:** Simplyblock's advanced data placement, which is based on small, fixed-size data
  chunks, ensures a perfectly balanced utilization of storage, compute, and network bandwidth, avoiding any performance
  bottlenecks local to specific nodes. This provides almost linear performance scalability for the cluster.

- **Containerized Architecture:** The solution comprises:
    - *Storage Nodes:* Container stacks delivering distributed data services via NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe over TCP),
      forming storage clusters.
    - *Management Nodes:* Container stacks offering control and management services, collectively known as the control
      plane.

- **Platform Support:** Simplyblock supports deployment on virtual machines, bare-metal instances, and Kubernetes
  containers, compatible with x86 and ARM architectures.

- **Deployment Flexibility:** Simplyblock offers the greatest deployment flexibility in the industry. It can be deployed
  **hyper-converged**, **disaggregated**, and in a **hybrid fashion**, combining the best of both worlds.
