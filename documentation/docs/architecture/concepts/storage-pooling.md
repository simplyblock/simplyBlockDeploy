Storage pooling is a technique used in distributed data storage systems to aggregate multiple storage devices into a
single, unified storage resource. This approach enhances resource utilization, improves scalability, and simplifies
management by abstracting physical storage infrastructure into a logical storage pool.

Traditional storage architectures often rely on dedicated storage devices assigned to specific applications or
workloads, leading to inefficiencies in resource allocation and potential underutilization. Storage pooling addresses
these challenges by combining storage resources from multiple nodes into a shared pool, allowing dynamic allocation
based on demand.

Key characteristics of storage pooling include:

- **Resource Aggregation:** Multiple physical storage devices, such as HDDs, SSDs, or NVMe drives, are combined into a single logical storage entity.
- **Dynamic Allocation:** Storage capacity can be allocated dynamically to workloads based on usage patterns and demand.
- **Improved Efficiency:** By eliminating the constraints of static storage assignments, storage pooling optimizes resource utilization and reduces wasted capacity.
- **Scalability:** Additional storage devices or nodes can seamlessly integrate into the storage pool without disrupting operations.
- **Simplified Management:** Centralized control and monitoring enable streamlined administration of storage resources.
- **Security Options:** Storage pools can define NVMe-oF security settings (DH-HMAC-CHAP authentication and TLS/PSK
  encryption) that are automatically applied to all volumes created within the pool. See
  [NVMe-oF Security](nvmf-security.md) for details.
