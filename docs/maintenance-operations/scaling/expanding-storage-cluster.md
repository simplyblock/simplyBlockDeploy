Simplyblock is designed as an always-on storage solution. Hence, storage cluster expansion is an online operation
without a need for maintenance downtime.

However, every operation that changes the cluster topology comes with a set of migration tasks, moving data across
the cluster to ensure equal usage distribution. While these migration tasks are low priority and their overhead is
designed to be minimal, it is still recommended to expand the cluster at times when the storage cluster isn't under
full utilization.

!!! info
    Add storage nodes in **pairs** (i.e., 2, 4, 6, … nodes at a time).  
    Expansions with an odd number of nodes are **not supported**.

To add a new storage node, follow the installation steps for your chosen deployment method up to the point where nodes are added to the cluster, then continue here:

- [Storage nodes in Kubernetes](../../deployments/kubernetes/index.md)
- [Storage nodes on Linux](../../deployments/install-on-linux/install-sp.md)

After adding the **first** new storage node, the cluster transitions to **IN_EXPANSION** and starts background rebalancing.
Add the remaining node(s) required for the expansion (storage nodes must be added in **pairs**).
Once all newly added nodes are healthy/ready, finalize the expansion:

```bash title="Finalize cluster expansion"
{{ cliname }} cluster complete-expand <CLUSTER_ID>
```

After the expansion is complete, the cluster returns to **ACTIVE** and resumes normal operation mode.

## Adding Worker Nodes with the Kubernetes Operator

When running simplyblock on Kubernetes, adding new worker nodes to the storage fabric is achieved by appending them to
the current `StorageNode.spec.workerNodes` configuration:

```bash title="Add worker nodes via the operator"
kubectl patch storagenode simplyblock-node -n simplyblock \
  --type=json -p '[
    {"op":"add","path":"/spec/workerNodes/-","value":"new-node-4"},
    {"op":"add","path":"/spec/workerNodes/-","value":"new-node-5"}
  ]'
```

The Simplyblock Operator automatically picks up on the change and will deploy the storage-node DaemonSet to the newly
added workers, register them with the simplyblock backend, and wait for each node to come online.

The backend transitions to **IN_EXPANSION** during this process.

Once the nodes are online, finalize the expansion using the `StorageCluster` action:

```bash title="Finalize expansion via the operator"
kubectl patch storagecluster simplyblock-cluster -n simplyblock \
  --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"action": "expand"}}'
```

Progress can be monitored using the `StorageCluster` status:

```bash title="Watch expansion status"
kubectl get storagecluster simplyblock-cluster -n simplyblock \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.status}{"\n"}' -w
```
