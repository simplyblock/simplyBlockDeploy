"""
test_delete_lvol_intent.py — regression tests for the early-IN_DELETION
persistence in ``simplyblock_core.controllers.lvol_controller.delete_lvol``.

Background: in n+k outage soak run 20260426-164436, a clone delete during
iter 5 (when the secondary + tertiary of LVS_5028 were being shut down)
was issued at 22:47:55 against an online-but-back-pressured leader (.202).
The leader's SPDK was processing a flood of qpair-cleanup events from the
container-killed peer; the 5s/×2 RPC budget in delete_lvol_from_node
expired and the leader op raised. delete_lvol then returned False without
ever writing STATUS_IN_DELETION or deletion_status to FDB. The lvol
stayed 'online'; the API returned ``{"results": False, "status": True}``
(HTTP 200); no background reconciler had any record of the deletion
intent; the test harness's deferred validation never re-issued the
DELETE; the clone became permanently orphaned even though a 4th attempt
~5 minutes later would have succeeded once SPDK settled.

Fix: persist STATUS_IN_DELETION before the data-plane RPC. lvol_monitor's
existing STATUS_IN_DELETION reconcile path then drives the delete to
completion in the background — surviving any number of transient
leader-RPC failures during an outage window without needing the harness
to retry.

These tests pin:
1. After delete_lvol returns, the lvol is in ``STATUS_IN_DELETION`` even
   when the leader op fails.
2. The status write happens BEFORE execute_on_leader_with_failover is
   invoked (call ordering on the DB mock).
3. A second delete_lvol on an already-in-deletion lvol short-circuits
   to True without re-running the leader op (idempotency invariant).
4. Source-level invariant: the IN_DELETION assignment in delete_lvol is
   located before the ha-type branch, not after it.
