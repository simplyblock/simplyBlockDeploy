"""Cross-process coordinator for hublvol NVMe-oF (re)attach.

All ``bdev_nvme_attach_controller`` / ``bdev_nvme_detach_controller`` calls
that target a hublvol subsystem (NQN of the form
``…:hublvol:LVS_xxxx``) must flow through :class:`HublvolReconnectCoordinator`.
That includes initial connect on secondary/tertiary startup, the restart
runner's hublvol wiring, the health service's periodic path repair, and the
storage-node-ops failover helpers.

The coordinator enforces three properties:

1. **Single serialized worker per ``(node_id, lvstore)`` subsystem.** An
   FDB-backed advisory lock with a TTL is held for the whole observe/detach/
   attach sequence. This is cross-process: different control-plane services
   (``TasksRunnerRestart``, ``HealthCheck``, ``StorageNodeMonitor``, SNodeAPI)
   cannot overlap on the same hublvol.

2. **Minimum cooldown between attach attempts.** After any completed
   attach/detach sequence the coordinator refuses to run another one within
   ``cooldown_sec``; a caller that arrives inside the window either observes
   an already-``enabled`` controller (no-op) or waits out the remaining
   cooldown before acting. This prevents the ``cntlid N are duplicated``
   race where a second ``bdev_nvme_attach_controller`` lands while SPDK is
   still driving ``nvme_ctrlr_destruct_poll_async`` on the prior controller.

3. **Detach-and-wait-gone before re-attach on a non-enabled controller.**
   Because SPDK's detach runs the final destroy asynchronously, the
   coordinator polls ``bdev_nvme_controller_list`` until the name is absent
   before issuing the next attach.

This is an in-repo coordinator — the SPDK target itself is not modified.
If a future refactor moves this logic into ``spdk_proxy`` / SNodeAPI as a
per-subnqn worker queue, the call sites here remain the same.

#: issuing a new attach before this completes is what produces
#: ``bdev_nvme_check_multipath: cntlid N are duplicated``.
DEFAULT_DETACH_WAIT_SEC = 10.0

#: Mandatory sleep between successive attach RPCs against the same
#: ``ctrl_name`` within a single reconcile (e.g. multipath path-by-path
#: attach). Even when the prior attach reports its controller as enabled
#: in ``bdev_nvme_controller_list``, SPDK may still be finalising
#: per-controller state for a short while. A small extra gap absorbs
#: that finalisation window. Combined with ``_ensure_attach_ready``
#: this prevents the back-to-back attach race that produces
#: ``cntlid N are duplicated`` (LVS_5918 incident, 2026-04-25 12:47:18).
INTER_ATTACH_SLEEP_SEC = 3.0

#: How long the FDB advisory lock lives if the holder crashes without
#: releasing. Must be >> typical reconcile runtime (including detach-wait).
#: Other callers block on the lock, not on the SPDK RPC, so this only bounds
#: dead-holder recovery.
DEFAULT_LOCK_TTL_SEC = 60

#: NVMe-oF ctrlr timeout params handed to ``bdev_nvme_attach_controller``
#: for hublvol controllers. Tightened so a dead primary surfaces to the
#: lvstore in seconds (so failover can proceed) instead of waiting 15 s+
#: on the bdev_nvme retry chain. The trade-off against the original
#: race-avoidance rationale (longer windows absorb short peer blips that
#: would otherwise drive a destroy→reattach race on the same subnqn) is
#: now carried by the coordinator's lock + cooldown rather than by
#: stretching the SPDK timers themselves.

          1. State-aware gating: before each attach, consult
             ``_ensure_attach_ready`` so an already-enabled path is a no-op
             and a hung controller is detached for a clean retry.
          2. A mandatory inter-attach sleep so SPDK has a window to
             finalise per-controller state between back-to-back path
             attaches in a single multipath fan-out. This protects against
             the race that produces ``cntlid N are duplicated`` even when
             the previous attach has reported the controller as registered.

        Foreground/background split: as soon as one path is in the desired
        enabled state, the remaining redundant paths are completed
        asynchronously in a daemon thread that still honours
        ``INTER_ATTACH_SLEEP_SEC`` (so the cntlid-duplicated race is still
        avoided), and we return ``True`` immediately. The caller — typically
        the failback flow on a non-leader replica — can then proceed to
        ``bdev_lvol_set_lvs_opts`` / ``bdev_lvol_connect_hublvol`` and the
        port-unblock signal without waiting for redundant-path setup.

        If the very first path fails, we fall through synchronously to the
        next path (still respecting the inter-attach sleep). Only when
        every path tried in the foreground fails do we return ``False``
        and abort the restart.

        Returns True if at least one path is in the desired enabled state
        after the loop. With ``verify_at_end=True`` (fresh create case), a
        final ``_wait_for_settled`` confirms that path is actually up.
